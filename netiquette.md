#TILDE.CLUB FAQ

------------------------------------------------------------
* WHAT IS THIS?

It is a UNIX server just like we used to use to host websites in 1995.

------------------------------------------------------------
* HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE ON THE SYSTEM?

A couple hundred. Otherwise it's ridiculous.

------------------------------------------------------------
* CAN I HAVE A LOGIN?

Until there are a couple hundred people, it's pretty open.

------------------------------------------------------------
* WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOR?

Be as much of a nerd as you want. Don't make other users uncomfortable
by talking about wangs and stuff. I'm old and cranky and I'll boot
you.

------------------------------------------------------------
* CAN I...

ACTUALLY...go easy. There are a few hundred people on this 
box so it gets a little overwhelmed at times.

------------------------------------------------------------
* CAN I HOST .AIFF FILES AND THINGS?

No, my god. This is a fun place to play not a place to download
Fractal Design Poser 3.

------------------------------------------------------------
* WHERE IS THE API?

There is an unofficial API for this unofficial site at:
http://tilde.club/~danielbachhuber/club-sites.json

There is more API at:

NEW USER TUTORIAL

tilde.club is just a tiny tiny server running linux on the amazon
cloud. Using tilde.club requires you to understand shells and ssh. If
you don't know about those things, consider this a challenge and
opportunity to learn! This concludes the tutorial.

IMPORTANT NOTES

Since I've now saddled myself in this clown rodeo, a few notes:

- No drama. What constitutes drama? There is a Mary J. Blige song
  called "No More Drama." If Mary J. Blige would think it was drama,
  it is drama.

- vim AND emacs are installed, use the one that is right for you. See
  "No drama," above.

- Chat with anyone you want using the talk command (ytalk seems to
  have gone missing from the Internet!). Just amuse yourself by
  pinging people and saying stuff at random. Don't be shy. If they
  bail or don't reply no worries. This is a unix server. The only
  people who want free accounts on unix servers are awesome cool
  loving generous nerds.

- If you don't want to chat there's a command that lets you indicate
  that. See if you can remember that command!

- This is a guilt-free project and total disaster is ALWAYS a possible
  outcome. I'll cover costs up to about $100 a month. I doubt I'll let
  more than a hundred or two hundred people on the system because
  randos ruin. There are a hundred people now.

- This thing is a de-facto whitey sausagefest so everyone be actively,
  aggressively cool and sweet and remember that the only binary that's
  real is the one that we use on our microchips.

MY SACRED VOWS TO YOU

I will do my best to do the following things:

1) I will make a weekly backup of the public_html directories so when
some teen in Estonia decides to hack in and ruin everything we can
bring up a new server and limp back to life.

2) I won't shut things down without a month of warning and once it's
shut down I'll make sure a file with all the public_html directories
is uploaded to archive.org.

3) If any community forms at all (DUBIOUS BUT SURPRISE ME) I promise I
won't blow up the community without, like, first pointing everyone to
some free IRC channel or something.
